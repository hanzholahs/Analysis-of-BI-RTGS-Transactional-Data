# Analisis Data Transaksi Sistem BI-RTGS

BI-RTGS is a real-time gross settlement payment system to process high-value transactions in Indonesia. Participants of BI-RTGS are suggested to follow the throughput guidelines to reduce the liquidity risk of sending transaction instructions at the end of the business day. One business day is divided into three zones: Zone I (min 30% of the daily transaction), Zone II (min 30%), dan Zone III (max 30%). 

This repository contains code in [R Language](https://www.r-project.org/) I wrote to analyse the trends in high-value transactions, specifically the distribution of time when banks send message instructions for their transactions. I leveraged several packages in [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) as it provides complete, end-to-end tools for data analysis and visualisation.
